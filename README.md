# INTRO

This is the README file for Nathan Potgieterâ€™s financial econometrics
project.

The aim of this project is to develop a general and easy to use Monte
Carlo package, that generates financial data with the possibility of
extreme joint down movements, as observed during financial crisis.

## Generating Covarience matrix

In this section I developed a simple function that allows the user to
easily generate a covarience matrix with the desired cluster structure.

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
