# INTRO

This is the README file for Nathan Potgieter's financial econometrics project. 

The aim of this project is to develop a general and easy to use Monte Carlo package, that generates financial data with the possibility of extreme joint down movements, as observed during financial crisis. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Generating Covarience matrix

In this section I developed a simple function that allows the user to easily generate a covarience matrix with the desired cluster structure. 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
